# Udacity Self Driving Car Simulation

This simulator was built for [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013), 
to teach students how to train cars how to navigate road courses using deep learning.

**The model is trained but there were some problems while simulating the model. If anyone can solve that, please feel free to do a PR.**
